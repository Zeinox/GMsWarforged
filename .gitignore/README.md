This will need to be updated to be more concise but for now.

You will need Node.js, a Discord API key, and a Youtube/Google API key.

The discord key will need to be stored in an auth.json will as a pair of "token: 'your key'".

The Google/youtube key will need to be stored in a ytKey.json with the pair "key: 'your api key'"

Regrettably, I had hardcoded my user id when developing 'admin' only commands.  So you will likely have to look through my code and replace it with your own, or more responsibly, you could replace it with a variable.
